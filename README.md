# Youtube Video Player + Search App

Simple react-based app that takes user input in a search field and returns multiple videos from Youtube based on the search terms. User can play video in video component, or can select a different video from the search results to the right of the video player. This app utilizes the public Youtube API to display search results.

I built this simple app in order to practice my understanding of the following topics:

- useState and useEffect hooks
- Making an API call with Axios
- Structuring my own data models
- API setup and authorization through Google
