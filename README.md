# Youtube Video Player + Search App

Simple react-based app that takes user input in a search field and returns multiple videos from Youtube based on the search terms. User can play video in video component, or can select a different video from the search results to the right of the video player. This app utilizes the public Youtube API to display search results.

I built this simple app in order to practice my understanding of the following topics:

- Crafting controlled forms
- Accessing and utilizing Google's Youtube Data API
- Building an app using class-based components rather than functional components
- Leveraging state and lifecycle methods SANS hooks
- General styling with Semantic-UI
